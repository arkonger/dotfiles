" A collection of maps and functions to handle long code comments without word
"   wrap:
" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"   __        : Splits the current line at the start of the word containing
"                 column 80.
" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"   _<Enter>  : Splits the current line using __, adds the comment delimiter
"                 (which is assumed to be the current word) to the start of
"                 the new line, and matches the previous line's indentation.
" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"   _-        : Works just as _<Enter>, but also indents the text after the
"                 delimiter
" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"   _<BS>     : Merges the current line with the previous one by deleting the
"                 comment delimiter and all the whitespace before the start of
"                 the text, and then backspacing into the previous line.
" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"   IndentComment(internalIndent)
"             : A function which performs the indentation in _<Enter> and _-
"               Arg: boolean internalIndent, which specifies whether to indent
"                 after the delimiter. For _<Enter>, this is false. For _-,
"                 this is true.
" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"   GotoWordBegin()
"             : A function which moves the cursor to the beginning of the
"                 current word. This can be achieved na√Øvely with "normal wb",
"                 but this solution handles punctuation poorly. Since this
"                 function detects words purely off of whitespace, it is able
"                 to handle punctuation much better.
" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"   SplitLine()
"             : A function which performs the line splitting in __
"               Return: either 0, indicating that it successfully split the
"                 line, or 1, indicating that it could not split the line.

" A function to toggle a "very magic mode" shortcut: 
"   Vim has a very versatile search function, given that it is capable of
"     executing all but the most arcane RegExes. However, the default search
"     behavior notably interprets many special characters (such as
"     parentheses, brackets, and even periods and plus signs) as literal
"     characters; to use them as special characters in a RegEx, they need to
"     be escaped. While this is very convenient for mundane (non-RegEx)
"     searches, it makes even simple RegExes quite cumbersome to type.
"     Fortunately, the \v and \V metacharacters can be used to drop in and out
"     of "very magic mode", which interprets all special characters as such --
"     no need to escape!
"   A simple map can be used to default to VMM by prepending searches with \v,
"     but this may not always be desirable. Therefore, the below function sets
"     and unsets the map as a toggle.
